    <h1>Home Run...</h1>
    <p>The distinct crack of the bat echoed through the stadium, </p>
    <p>a sound that needed no replay to announce its meaning. The ball, </p>
    <p>a white missile with red seams, disappeared into the sky, </p>
    <p>carrying with it the hopes of thousands of fans.</p>
